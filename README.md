🚀 Web Application Security & DevSecOps Project Portfolio  
**Artifact-as-Legacy | Quantum-Safe Builder | Actionable Mentor**

Welcome! I’m Rashard — a Web Application Security Engineer and blueprint architect specializing in DevSecOps leadership, policy-as-code, and quantum-safe development. I build secure, resilient cloud-native applications from design to deployment, and mentor rising engineers through actionable progress and ritualized drills.

🌐 **About This Portfolio**  
This repository is both a technical showcase and a movement-builder’s hub, highlighting hands-on demonstrations across cloud security, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and advanced automation. Every commit is a teaching moment—crafted with transparency, sharpened by repetition, and built to inspire.

🛠️ **Philosophy: Actionable DevSecOps + Secure Design**  
- 🧪 Learn by doing: Iterative projects solving real-world cloud security challenges  
- 🔍 Share what works: Transparent documentation of wins, failures, and refactors  
- 🛡️ Embed security: GitHub Advanced Security + Codespaces + Quantum tooling  
- 🤝 Build culture: Security enablement, cohort feedback, and cross-org collaboration

🎯 **Featured Competencies**  
- AppSec: OWASP Top 10, Threat Modeling, Secure SDLC, Manual/Automated Testing  
- DevSecOps: SAST, SCA, Secret Scanning, GitHub Actions, Supply Chain Hardening  
- Cloud: Kubernetes, IaC Security, Runtime Controls, PQC Readiness  
- Policy: Security Standards, Developer Training, Power BI Governance Reporting

📌 **Live Projects & Demos**  
- ✔️ SQL Injection Incident Response (OWASP Juice Shop)  
- ✔️ DevSecOps Pipeline w/ Post-Quantum Scanning
