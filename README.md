🚀 Web Application Security & DevSecOps Project Portfolio
Artifact-as-Legacy | Quantum-Safe Builder | Actionable Mentor
Welcome! I’m Rashard — a Web Application Security Engineer and blueprint architect specializing in DevSecOps leadership, policy-as-code, and quantum-safe development.
I build secure, resilient cloud-native applications from design to deployment, and mentor rising engineers through actionable progress and ritualized drills.


🌐 About This Portfolio
This repository is both a technical showcase and a movement-builder’s hub.
It highlights hands-on demonstrations across cloud security, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and advanced automation.
Every commit is a teaching moment—crafted with transparency, sharpened by repetition, and built to inspire.


🧭 Role Alignment: Skills in Action
This portfolio reflects the kind of impact expected from engineers who secure software supply chains at scale.
It demonstrates not just technical proficiency—but ownership, reproducibility, and mentorship.
🔧 Capability Area	✅ Demonstrated Skillset
Automated Vulnerability Detection	Custom CodeQL queries, Semgrep rules, GHAS alert triage, Copilot Autofix refinement
Secure Development Lifecycle	SOP.md workflows, teachback.md annotations, CI/CD integration of security tooling
Tooling & Frameworks	GitHub Advanced Security, Codespaces, IaC scanning, SBOM generation
Campaign Ownership	Security skit modules, annotated onboarding artifacts, cross-team enablement
Supply Chain Risk Reduction	Secrets scanning, dependency analysis, runtime controls, quantum-safe migration planning
Mentorship & Enablement	Actionable training modules, Cornell-style SOPs, teachable commits, cohort feedback
Cross-Functional Collaboration	Movement-building playbooks, annotated demos, reproducible onboarding systems


🛠️ Philosophy: Actionable DevSecOps + Secure Design
	• 🧪 Learn by doing: Iterative projects solving real-world cloud security challenges
	• 🔍 Share what works: Transparent documentation of wins, failures, and refactors
	• 🛡️ Embed security: GitHub Advanced Security + Codespaces + Quantum tooling
	• 🤝 Build culture: Security enablement, cohort feedback, and cross-org collaboration


🎯 Featured Competencies
	• AppSec: OWASP Top 10, Threat Modeling, Secure SDLC, Manual/Automated Testing
	• DevSecOps: SAST, SCA, Secret Scanning, GitHub Actions, Supply Chain Hardening
	• Cloud: Kubernetes, IaC Security, Runtime Controls, PQC Readiness
	• Policy: Security Standards, Developer Training, Power BI Governance Reporting


📌 Live Projects & Demos
	• ✔️ SQL Injection Incident Response (OWASP Juice Shop)
	• ✔️ DevSecOps Pipeline w/ Post-Quantum Scanning
	• ✔️ Supply Chain Security Lab (Secrets, CodeQL, Dependabot)
	• ✔️ Quantum Security Toolkit (Assessment + Migration Planning)
	• ✔️ Cloud-Native Patterns (IaC + Runtime Tests)


🎭 Security Skit Library
Real exploits. Teachable scenes. Reproducible remediation.
Each module dramatizes a real-world vulnerability as a teachable scene, complete with:
	• 🎬 Narrative-driven exploits
	• 🧠 Annotated teachbacks
	• 📜 Cornell-style SOPs
	• 🤖 Copilot Autofix critiques
	Built to scale secure coding culture across teams and time.


💡 AppSec Mission Statement
	“Security isn’t reactive—it’s cadence, culture, conviction, mentorship, mastery, motion, and leadership.”
