## ðŸ‘‹ About This Repository
This repo is part of my hands-on GitHub portfolio, where I document real-world security challenges, automation, and continuous learning. My approach is simple:
**Learn by doing, share what works, and build a resilient, secure foundation for modern development.**

## ðŸŒ± My Method: Project-Based Learning
- **Actionable Progress:** Every project here is a step forwardâ€”tested, documented, and shared for others to learn from.
- **Transparency:** I share not just successes, but lessons learned from mistakes and experiments.
- **Automation & Security:** Leveraging GitHub Advanced Security, Codespaces, Dependabot, and AI tools to automate and secure the software supply chain.
- **Community:** I invite feedback, collaboration, and questionsâ€”letâ€™s grow together!

## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here
- Real-world exercises in supply chain security, secret scanning, and automated remediation.
- Clean, well-documented code and commit history.
- Visuals, key learnings, and security best practices.
- A focus on cloud-native, DevSecOps, and continuous improvement.
