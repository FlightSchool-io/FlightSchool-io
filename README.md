Welcome! I'm **Rashard** â€” a **Web Application Security Engineer** with a passion for building secure, resilient cloud-native applications from **design to deployment**. My expertise lies in architecting robust DevSecOps pipelines, leading proactive vulnerability management, and driving the implementation of complex security policies. As a quantum-focused engineer and continuous learner, I'm dedicated to defining and securing the future of cloud development through actionable, project-based progress.

## ðŸ‘‹ About This Repository

This repository serves as my hands-on portfolio, showcasing my expertise in tackling **real-world cloud security challenges**, including **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) implementations**, advanced automation, and continuous learning. My '1% better' methodology drives an approach of learning by doing, sharing actionable solutions, and building a resilient, quantum-safe foundation for modern cloud development.

## ðŸŒ± My Method: Project-Based Learning

* **Actionable Progress:** Every project here embodies my 'learn by doing, share what works' philosophy, showcasing how I drive actionable progress in solving real-world security challenges through **iterative design, testing, and documentation**.
* **Transparency:** I emphasize transparent documentation, sharing not just successes but also crucial lessons learned from iterative experiments and refactoring. This demonstrates a commitment to true continuous improvement and **proactive problem-solving**.
* **Automation & Integrated Security:** My approach deeply embeds security into the SDLC, leveraging **GitHub Advanced Security (CodeQL, Dependabot), Codespaces, and AI tools** to automate and secure the software supply chain. This includes a growing focus on quantum-resistant techniques and **enforcing security policies through code**.
* **Collaboration & Culture:** I actively foster a culture of collaboration, inviting feedback and contributions. My goal is to serve as a **catalyst for secure development practices**, empowering teams and growing together in this evolving threat landscape.

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy on Collaboration & Driving Change

I believe in building strong, collaborative security cultures. As **Coach Dan Quinn famously said, "We didn't come to change this, but to *amplify* [the organization]."** My approach to AppSec is precisely that: not to disrupt, but to amplify our ability to deliver secure, high-quality software faster. I partner with development and operations teams, providing guidance and enabling them with the right tools and knowledge to build security in from the start, rather than waiting for painful, late-stage fixes. This fosters shared ownership and elevates our collective security posture.
