# 🚀 Web Application Security & DevSecOps Project Portfolio

**Artifact-as-Legacy | Quantum-Safe Builder | Actionable Mentor**  
Welcome! I’m Rashard—a Web Application Security Engineer, blueprint architect, and DevSecOps leader. My expertise spans policy-as-code, quantum-safe development, and actionable mentorship. I build resilient cloud-native applications end-to-end and empower engineers with practical, repeatable progress.

## 🌐 About This Portfolio

This repository is both a technical showcase and a movement-building hub.  
It features:
- Hands-on demonstrations across cloud security, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and advanced automation.
- Every commit as a teaching moment—crafted for transparency, repeated for mastery, and designed to inspire.

## 🎭 Security Skit Library

*Real exploits. Teachable scenes. Reproducible remediation.*

Each module dramatizes a real-world vulnerability:
- Narrative-driven exploits
- Annotated teachbacks
- Cornell-style SOPs
- Copilot Autofix critiques

*Built to scale secure coding culture across teams and time.*
