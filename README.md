# üöÄ Web Application Security & DevSecOps Project Portfolio

**Artifact-as-Legacy | Quantum-Safe Builder | Actionable Mentor**  
Welcome! I‚Äôm Rashard‚Äîa Web Application Security Engineer, blueprint architect, and DevSecOps leader. My expertise spans policy-as-code, quantum-safe development, and actionable mentorship. I build resilient cloud-native applications end-to-end and empower engineers with practical, repeatable progress.

## üåê About This Portfolio

This repository is both a technical showcase and a movement-building hub.  
It features:
- Hands-on demonstrations across cloud security, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and advanced automation.
- Every commit as a teaching moment‚Äîcrafted for transparency, repeated for mastery, and designed to inspire.

## üí° Philosophy: Actionable DevSecOps + Secure Design

- **Learn by doing:** Iterative projects solving real-world challenges
- **Share what works:** Document wins, failures, and refactors
- **Embed security:** GitHub Advanced Security, Codespaces, Quantum tooling
- **Build culture:** Enablement, cohort feedback, cross-org collaboration

---

## üèÜ Featured Competencies

- **AppSec:** OWASP Top 10, Threat Modeling, Secure SDLC, Manual/Automated Testing
- **DevSecOps:** SAST, SCA, Secret Scanning, GitHub Actions, Supply Chain Hardening
- **Cloud:** Kubernetes, IaC Security, Runtime Controls, PQC Readiness
- **Policy:** Security Standards, Developer Training, Power BI Governance Reporting

## üöß Live Projects & Demos

- **SQL Injection Incident Response** (OWASP Juice Shop)
- **DevSecOps Pipeline** w/ Post-Quantum Scanning
- **Supply Chain Security Lab** (Secrets, CodeQL, Dependabot)
- **Quantum Security Toolkit** (Assessment & Migration Planning)
- **Cloud-Native Patterns** (IaC + Runtime Tests)

## üé≠ Security Skit Library

*Real exploits. Teachable scenes. Reproducible remediation.*

Each module dramatizes a real-world vulnerability:
- Narrative-driven exploits
- Annotated teachbacks
- Cornell-style SOPs
- Copilot Autofix critiques

*Built to scale secure coding culture across teams and time.*

## üìé Mirroring Text with Embedded Screenshots

Sometimes, you may want to include a visual copy (Word or PDF screenshot) of your text for reference or archiving. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

**Example Section:**

```
This is a sample sentence that appears in both the README and a screenshot below.
```

![Sample Screenshot: README in Word Document](images/sample-word-screenshot.png)
*Above: Screenshot of README content as seen in Word.*

![Sample Screenshot: README in PDF](images/sample-pdf-screenshot.png)
*Above: Screenshot of README content as seen in PDF.*

**How To Embed Images in Markdown:**
```markdown
![Alt text describing the image](relative/path/to/image.png)
```
- Place your image in your repository (e.g., `images/` folder).
- Use the relative path to reference it.

---

**Tip:**  
Embedding screenshots of your README as it appears in Word or PDF helps with documentation consistency, presentation, and archival.
