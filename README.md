## ðŸ‘‹ About This Repository
This repository serves as my hands-on portfolio, documenting real-world security challenges, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) implementations, automation, and continuous learning. My '1% better' methodology drives an approach of learning by doing, sharing actionable solutions, and building a resilient, quantum-safe foundation for modern cloud development.

## ðŸŒ± My Method: Project-Based Learning
- **Actionable Progress:** Every project here is a step forward â€“ tested, documented, and shared for others to learn from, embodying my '1% better' approach to solving real-world challenges.
- **Transparency:** I share not just successes, but crucial lessons learned from iterative experiments and refactoring, demonstrating true continuous improvement.
- **Automation & Security:**  Leveraging GitHub Advanced Security, Codespaces, Dependabot, and AI tools to automate and secure the software supply chain, with an increasing focus on quantum-resistant techniques.
- **Community:** I actively invite feedback, collaboration, and questions â€“ letâ€™s learn and grow together in this evolving threat landscape!

## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here
- Real-world exercises in supply chain security, secret scanning, and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) implementation.
- Demos of automated remediation and quantum-safe configurations within cloud environments.
- Clean, well-documented code and commit history showcasing continuous improvement and iterative development.
- Key learnings, security best practices, and insights into virtualization security.
- A strong focus on cloud-native, DevSecOps, and quantum-readiness.
